.SH DESCRIPTION
.B love-release.sh
can be used to generate Love 2D game applications
and get over the fastidious zipping commands you had to do.
.PP
The script fully supports Windows, MacOS either on x86 or x64,
Debian and Android packages.
It needs an Internet connection to download Love files,
and relies on \fBcurl\fR, \fBzip\fR and \fBunzip\fR commands.
To set the default Love version to use,
you can edit the very beginning of the script.
If \fBlua\fR and a \fIconf.lua\fR file are found,
it will automatically detect which version your project uses.

or write your own build script, see \fIscripts/example.sh\fR.
.SH ICONS
The script doesn’t yet handle the process of creating icons,
but if provided it can use them.
.br
If you want to create MacOS icons (\fI.icns\fR), and you are
running MacOS, then check \fIiconutil\fR. If you are running GNU/Linux,
then check \fIlibicns\fR.
.br
If you want to create Windows icons (\fI.ico\fR),
you can use \fIicoutils\fR to create the icon,
then Wine and Resource Hacker to set the icon.
This last step can be automatically done,
assuming Wine is installed.
